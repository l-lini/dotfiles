My system configuration for my desktop `monster` and my laptop `power`. Named after my two favourite substances, [Powerking](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerking) and [Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Energy). If I get another computer then I would probably name it [Koskenkorva](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koskenkorva_(dryck)).

# Workflow
Make changes on the `dev` branch and once the system build is successfull merge to `main`. `main` should never have a configuration that does not build.
